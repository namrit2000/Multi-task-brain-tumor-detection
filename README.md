# üß† Multi-Task Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning

This project presents a unified deep learning architecture for the classification and segmentation of brain tumors using contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans. The study investigates multi-task learning (MTL) with a ResNet50 backbone and compares it against a segmentation-only baseline using EfficientNetB0.

## üß™ Models Implemented

### 1. EfficientNetB0 U-Net (Segmentation Only)
- Encoder: EfficientNetB0
- Decoder: Custom transpose conv stack
- Loss: Dice + Binary Cross Entropy  
- Outcome: High Mean IoU (1.00) but lacked classification; showed instability

### 2. ResNet50 Multi-Task Model (Classification + Segmentation)
- Shared Encoder: Pretrained ResNet50
- Dual Heads:
  - **Classification**: Fully connected + Softmax
  - **Segmentation**: Decoder + Sigmoid
- Losses:
  - Categorical Crossentropy (classification)
  - Binary Crossentropy (segmentation)
- Optimizer: Adam
- Regularization: Early stopping, class weights for imbalance
